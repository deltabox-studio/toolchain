# Changelog

## 2.4.0 (November 2026)

<!-- release:start -->

### New features
#### Project
- Add config generation options and migration routing ([#c658b0d](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/c658b0d) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
  - Support --skip-config, --language and --config-extension, write the project graph before configs, generate TS/JS configs, and route migrated fmt/lint into toolchain.vite only when the existing Vite config owns them.
#### Core
- Add import sorting defaults and workspace groups ([#1c5f5a3](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/1c5f5a3) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
  - Enable sortImports by default, resolve a workspace custom group from the project graph, and inject it into resolveVite, vite sync and tooling normalization.
### Chores
- Regenerate managed configs for import sorting ([#ce7a2e6](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/ce7a2e6) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
  - Regenerate .oxfmtrc.json and every workspace vite.config.ts with the resolved sortImports workspace group.

## 2.3.1 (November 2026)

### Bug fixes
#### Vite
- Use the Oxlint rule name react/exhaustive-deps ([#ea02ef7](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/ea02ef7) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
  - The dogfood config used the legacy ESLint name, so the generated Oxc configs carried both spellings. Rename it to the name in the vendored Oxlint schema and add a guard that every default rule exists there.
#### Core
- Preserve .vscode settings comments when adding keys ([#9b4a105](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/9b4a105) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
  - Merging VS Code settings parsed and reserialized the file, dropping its JSONC comments. Insert missing keys in place (preserving layout) and fall back to a full rewrite only when an existing value or array must change.
#### Ci
- Check and regenerate nested workspace configs recursively ([#711c7b4](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/711c7b4) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
  - The generated schema types are formatted at printWidth 300 and excluded from the formatter, but the ignore patterns were repo-root-relative. Per-workspace vp fmt resolves them from each package directory, so yarn format reformatted biome-config.ts and failed the artifact check. Use **/ globs and make the generated CI/sync workflows run dbx sync --check --recursive so stale workspace configs are caught and regenerated.

## 2.3.0 (November 2026)

### Bug fixes
#### Core
- Keep VS Code files user-owned and guard registry cycles ([#9ef027a](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/9ef027a) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
- Keep watch sessions alive and re-sync config edits ([#2849757](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/2849757) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
- Reject conflicting `--config` flags ([#1044f2a](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/1044f2a) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
- Skip parent hooks for config-less workspaces ([#9658c36](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/9658c36) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
- Keep managed paths inside the project root ([#2496bee](https://github.com/deltabox-studio/toolchain/commit/2496bee) by [T0chi](https://github.com/T0chi))
